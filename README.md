# [Next Blog](https://vitorpatzlaff-nextblog.vercel.app/)
This is a blog made with Next.js. Next.js is a framework that helps React.js in production, it has single page application features, server side rendering and more, visit [Next.js website](https://nextjs.org/) to see more about it.  
The posts are made in markdown, I used react-markdown and gray-matter to render it. The blog has a contact page, so the user can give a feeback, it is storaged in MongoDB (NoSQL database).

#### Enjoy!
